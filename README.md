# image-only-quizlet
a quick 2-3 hour copy/paste session where I implement the basics of a flashcard app which only supports images.

I will probably add image upload support and other qol features but that will probably be for later since I have too many projects at the moment

# future plans:
uploading images instead of copy/pasting/renaming the files

in-built instructions

maybe text option for the answers

weighted randomess(?) including the "i got it" and "i didn't get it" buttons
